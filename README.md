# EHV-1-dynamic
 
This repository contains scripts that were used to analyse the dynamics of the transcriptionsl changes in EHV-1.  
Long-read nanopore RNA-seq was carried out to sequence viral infected RK-13 cells.  
The resulting reads weer mapped to the viral genome and the produced bamfiles were analysed here.
These scripts were used to carry out the analyses and produce the figures for publication.
